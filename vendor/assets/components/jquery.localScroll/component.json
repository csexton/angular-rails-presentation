Check that plugin's documentation for further information.\n\n* If you want to convert the links from ALL over the page, with the same settings, just call $.localScroll(...) instead of $(...).localScroll(...)\n\n* Most of this plugin's defaults, belong to jQuery.ScrollTo, check it's demo for an example of each option.",
